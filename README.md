This is Poll Project created by me for the university. There is an administrator when startup the project. 
The name is admin@abv.bg and pass 12. The admin can change, 
remove and create polls.The admin can send emails with links for the polls also can watch diagrams
and can export to CSV format for the poll. When you've got email with link, can answer the question(s) and then will have 
another email to see your answer of the poll with hashcode. Based on MVC 5. Used technology stuff Html, Css, JavaScript(jQuery), Ajax and Json.
